	I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Prof. S. N. Merchant for his invaluable guidance throughout the three years of my association with him. They have always been accessible and willing to clear my doubts and have provided valuable insights that helped me develop new ways to approach the problem and come up with better solutions.\\ %\vspace{0.2in}

		We explore the application of compressed sensing for solving problems in radio astronomy where the source images are generally sparse in some domain. We obtain an incomplete set of noisy Fourier measurements of the image through the radio telescope array and the goal is to reconstruct the image by making use of the sparse nature of the images.

		In this report we consider the case where we have multiple sets of Fourier measurements corresponding to different images and in addition we have some knowledge about some overlapping information between the  images. By making use of the overlapping information we should be able to perform better reconstruction than in the case where we perform the reconstruction for the images independently. 

		We propose a coupled formulation where we solve a joint minimization problem to perform simultaneous recovery of multiple images. We restrict ourselves to the case where we have two images and present an alternating algorithm that solves the joint minimization problem.

		We conduct experiments on different classes of images that include images that are sparse in spatial domain, images that are sparse in wavelet domain and images that are sum of a spatial domain sparse component and a wavelet domain sparse component. In all the cases we observed that the coupled formulation that does simulataneous recovery has better performance as compared to when we perform the reconstructions independently.
