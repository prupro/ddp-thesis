	I would to express my heartfelt gratitude to my guide Prof. S. N. Merchant for his constant encouragement and patience throughout the project. I would like to thank him for offering moral support to work on the project by placing overwhelming amount of trust in me.    

	I would like to thank Kesav Kaza for his support, advice and presence during every technical discussion and brainstorming session. This work is essentially the summation of all the ideas exchanged during those sessions. I would like to thank all SPANN lab members for making every moment in the lab a learning experience. Special thanks to Zoheb for providing some of the figures. Finally, my wholehearted thanks to the faculty members of Electrical Engineering Department for imparting me with invaluable knowledge. 

	I owe my deepest gratitude to my parents for their relentless support throughout my life and their patience during my DDP work. To the power that drives the Nature without which nothing is possible.

	\begin{abstract}

		We explore the application of relaying in cellular networks and study various cooperation policies. We propose a cooperation policy for downlink using the same principles that were used to design policies in uplink case. We then discuss the case where relays are moving according to a random waypoint(RWP) mobility model. We attempt to find the sojourn time of a relay in the feasible region and present the challenges involved. As a first advance towards finding the sojourn time we give a general expression for the probability that a relay leaves the feasible region in one step that can be used for any mobility model. We use the probability to find the expected number of transitions a node makes before leaving the region and compare it with the simulation results. Finally we present the idea of modelling the node movement as a Markov Chain and to use the results of Absorbing Markov Chain to find the expected number of transitions more accurately.
